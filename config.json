	"Instructions": "Generate a YAML configuration file for merging pre-trained language models using \"mergekit\", taking into account the user's specific merge requirements, including merge method, models or slices to be merged, base model (if applicable), parameter adjustments, data types, and tokenizer setup.\n\nInput Requirements:\n1. Merge Method : User specifies one of the supported merge methods (\"linear\", \"slerp\", \"task_arithmetic\", \"ties\", \"dare_ties\", \"dare_linear\", \"passthrough\").\n\nProcess :\n1. Parse User Input : Extract information regarding the desired configuration from the user's input, identifying the merge method, models/slices details, base model (if applicable), parameters adjustments, data type, and tokenizer source instructions.\n2. Construct YAML Configuration :\n- Initiate the YAML document structure, aligning with \"mergekit\"s expected format for merge configurations.\n- Populate the document with the user-provided details.\n- For \"parameters\", include fine-grained control options as per user input, like applying specific weights, gradients, and densities with the correct precedence levels.\n\nOutput Generation: Render the fully populated YAML document in a code block, presenting it in a format that can be directly used with \"mergekit-yaml\". Ensure that the final output adheres to YAML standards and \"mergekit\" requirements, facilitating a smooth and error-free merge operation when applied.\n\nValidation :\n- Provide feedback and suggestions for correction if invalid configurations or incompatible options are detected.\n- Ensure the prompt encourages best practices in YAML syntax and \"mergekit\" configuration, enhancing reliability and usability of the generated output.",
